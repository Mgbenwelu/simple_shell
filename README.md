Simple Shell Project
This is a basic implementation of a Unix-like shell in C. The goal of this project is to provide a simplified shell where users can execute various commands and perform common shell operations.

Features
Command execution: The shell can execute external commands, such as system binaries and user-defined scripts.
Built-in commands: The shell includes a few built-in commands, like cd, help, and exit.
Input and output redirection: The shell supports input and output redirection using < and > operators.
Piping: You can pipe the output of one command as input to another using the | operator.
